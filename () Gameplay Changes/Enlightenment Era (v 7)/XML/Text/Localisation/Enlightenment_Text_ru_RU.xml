			<Text>The use of larger guns with more penetrating power and explosive shells made naval armour plating imperative. Among early experiments were floating armoured batteries built for the Crimean War. Heavy wrought-iron plates over a thick wooden backing gave these flat-bottomed vessels outstanding protection as they carried large-shell guns close inshore. Other developments followed swiftly. The British soon built the first iron-hulled floating batteries, and the French followed in 1860 with the first seagoing armoured warships protected throughout their entire length by a wrought-iron belt. Belt armor soon became standard fare for battleships, cruisers, and aircraft carriers. An air space between the armor belt and the hull would also add to the buoyancy of the warship, and this was often done to increase protection against either torpedoes or shells. In other designs, the spaces around the main belt were filled with storage tanks that could contain oil, seawater, or fresh water. There, the liquids in the tanks absorbed or scattered much of the explosive force of warheads.</Text>

They retained this status up until the mid 19th century, when they were gradually phased out and replaced with the percussion lock and, later, the cartridge-based systems.</Text>

			<Text>In its most basic form, Imperialism describes an unequal relationship between one nation and another, where the former has some amount of control over the latter country - usually in the form of some kind of empire.  Imperialistic dynasties can be found in all the histories of the world, from China to Rome to Britain, and imperialism as a concept has existed for thousands of years, just about as long as governments in general.  The term "imperialism", however, wasn't coined until the 16th century, where it was used to describe the foreign policies and proceedings of nations like Spain, Britain, Belgium, and the Netherlands, as they swiftly built up imperial ties with the Americas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While Imperialism is traditionally connected with the large, iconic, militaristic empire, it can be exhibited in a much more subtle manner.  Formal control of the weaker state's government isn't always necessary, and a stronger civilization will sometimes control a weaker one purely through indirect economic, political or religious means.</Text>

In pre-industrial societies, the production of such merchandise was often carried out by artisans, overseen by collective guilds which ensured the protection and enterprise of their craft. Alongside the development of factories, and, particularly, with the advent of the Assembly Line in the 1910s, manufacturing became an industrial process, often concerned with the mass production of goods for profit. Manufactories - complexes of factories, assembly plants, foundries, etc. - thus became highly mechanized, and the need for such skilled artisans in the manufacturing process became obsolete.</Text>

			<Text>Natural history is the study of animals, plants, and other organisms as they exist in nature. Naturalists - those who study natural history - often observe, rather than experiment with, their natural surroundings, and have played a pivotal role in the discovery and collection of new and exotic life forms.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Aristotle is, arguably, the forefather of natural historians, who first analyzed the natural world. In medieval Europe, his works were adapted into contemporary theology, which would expand upon the field as it related to the existence of God. A secular application of this knowledge would then come during the Renaissance, as disciplines such as botany, zoology, and geology began to emerge. By the Victorian Era, spurred on by the age of empires, naturalists began to amass private collections of sometimes thousands of animals and plants. These collections would go on to form the basis of natural history museums and zoos which, today, are commonplace.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One of the greatest naturalists of perhaps the discipline’s history is Charles Darwin. Darwin, who travelled years at a time across the globe, and who collected many new specimens, conceived of his theory of evolution by observing the natural history of the Galapagos islands. In doing so, he, among others, would pave the way for natural history to becoming a theory-based, rather than a strictly descriptive, science, confirming its place among the natural sciences today.</Text>

			<Text>The Romantic era was an age of literary and artistic expression which grew out of opposition to the scientific Enlightenment. It was characterised by ideals of freedom and idealism versus ideals of rationalism and realism. Many romantic thinkers were great artists, musicians, and writers, who sought to elicit intense emotion as a means to see the world around them. These thinkers would come to shape the political ideas of liberalism and radicalism which contrast so deeply with the pessimistic and cynical ideas of conservatism and realism of the modern age.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Romanticism reached its peak during the 19th Century, at the height of the Industrial Revolution. Artists and writers from England to Russia all celebrated in an idealistic view of humankind. Its emphasis on imagination and individual heroism was a popular distraction from the rapid changes heralded by an age dominated by global and urban empires seeking wealth and gain. It criticised authority and intellectual objectivity, and gave society a sense of quality and unity which would come to inspire ideals of the nationalism and fraternity.</Text>

			<Text>Sovereignty</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_TECH_EE_SOVEREIGNTY_DESC">
			<Text>Sovereignty is the political concept of supreme authority. Although in the modern sense sovereignty is usually associated with the highest authority of or within a state, it can also refer to the highest means of any individual to take independent action. This was the traditional sense of the word during the Middle Ages, when sovereignty was merely translated as being the legal or assertive capability of any individual to act independent of others. It was not until the Age of Enlightenment and the Peace of Westphalia that sovereignty became regarded legally as being the power of states to act autonomously of one another.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sovereignty first became popularised by the idea of the “Social Contract,” which was first conceived by the political philosopher Thomas Hobbes as a means to explain the inception of society. Hobbes stipulated that, in order to avoid a state of perpetual conflict between mankind, or a state of “war of all against all,” individuals consent to giving up certain freedoms and benefits to an absolute and indivisible authority that can compel mankind to act in the common interest.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On this basis was created the ideal of Absolute Monarchy, which would be practiced in states such as Sweden and Prussia during the 17th and 18th centuries. The French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, however, would conceive of the notion of popular sovereignty, which instead considers supreme authority as being legitimately held by the people, and merely entrusted into a government to be exercised. It was on the basis of this popular sovereignty that nations such as the United States of America and the French Republic were conceived.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Today, most legitimate forms of sovereignty are either popular (as in a Presidential Republic, or as in the Kingdoms of Belgium and Sweden, and the State of Japan) or Parliamentary (as in a Constitutional Monarchy or Parliamentary Republic). In the case of the latter, sovereignty is retained by a supreme authority (the people or the monarch), but exercised on that authority’s behalf by a Parliament, which is usually democratically elected. In this way, most forms of sovereignty are, at least hypothetically, de facto exercised by popular consent, differing greatly from the indivisible form of which Hobbes first conceived.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_TECH_EE_WARSHIPS_DESC">
			<Text>While many ships are engineered to cross oceans quickly or take the greatest amount of cargo in the smallest possible space, warships were designed for one purpose alone - destroying other ships.  Besides obviously being armed with some form of weapon (traditionally things like cannon or rams), warships can also withstand more damage and are much more maneuverable than something like a merchant or passenger vessel.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As naval technologies have advanced, so has the warship.  Galleys and triremes were early forms of warships capable of ramming enemy vessels, but usually combat was performed by the army onboard.  However, once cannon became capable of quick reloads, large sail-driven ships were employed which held rows of cannon along each side of the craft. Eventually these wooden ships were given up for ones made of iron and steel, and sails were abandoned for steam and nuclear power. While modern warships bear little resemblance to the earliest galleys, they still keep to the same basic design principles - be capable of destroying the other guy first, before he can take out you.</Text>

			<Text>A bastion is an angular projection extending from a fortification, specifically designed to address the changes gunpowder had brought to the landscape of war. Their angular shape eliminated dead space in front of the bastion, allowing neighboring bastions to fire upon enemies should they reach the base. Bastions tend to be short and broad, providing ample room for cannons and their crews while presenting a smaller profile for enemy artillery to attack. Should a cannonball strike the bastion and penetrate its stone facade, the interior of hard-packed earth and rubble would absorb the blow. Advances in artillery during the 19th Century, however, would render even these defensive measures obsolete.</Text>

The medieval manor was generally fortified in proportion to the degree of peaceful settlement of the country or region in which it was located. It served as the center of secular village life, and its great hall was the scene of the manorial court and the place of assembly of the tenantry. With increased prosperity and the desire for more commodious dwellings, the 16th-century manor house evolved into the Renaissance country house. In England more elaborate buildings were constructed, reflecting a new era of formality. The houses were frequently of regular quadrangular plan, with the hall diminished in size and importance. In later years the title of manor house in England lost particular significance, having been adopted by large country mansions that had no manorial foundation.</Text>

			<Text>Establishments for the dispensation and consumption of alcoholic beverages have been a fixture of cities throughout human civilization. The Babylonian Code of Hammurabi suggests the death penalty for proprietors diluting beer, while the ancient Greek lesche and phatnai catered to the needs of foreign traders and envoys. The traditional English tavern has its roots in the Roman period and, although still considered a place of ill-repute, the taberna was understood as a higher class establishment than the similar caupona which served slaves and the lower classes. Tabernae eventually evolved into alehouses run by women and finally the medieval English inn; sanctuaries for wayfaring strangers, thieves, and political malcontents. By the middle of the 16th century the dining-out habit was well established among townsmen of all classes, and the tavern originated the custom of providing a daily meal at a fixed time. As taverns gradually became more socially acceptable, some of the better houses became regular meeting halls and unofficial clubhouses providing companionship to the masses.</Text>

The architecture of the fort is unique to Ethiopia, bending the styles of Nubian, Arabian and Baroque architecture. The site houses castles, Iyasu’s Palace, stables and three churches amongst other rooms. Before the building of the fort in about 1635 the emperors of Ethiopia travelled and lived off the land, resting in tents. Emperor Fasilides broke this tradition by founding the city of Gondar and establishing it as his capital. Upon founding the city Fasilides then instructed the creation of ‘Fasil Gemb’ - Fasilides Castle. Since his death later emperors expanded on Fasil Gemb to eventually cover roughly 70,000 square meters of fortified space. The historian Thomas Pakenham visited the site during the 1950’s, noting that among the halls and palaces were what appeared to be pavilions and kiosks of the imperial city therein.

It was constructed under the reign of Eric of Pomerania during the 1420s. Along with Kärnan, another Danish fortress situated across the 4km wide Øresund, it was built predominantly to control the entrance to the Baltic Sea. This allowed for the Danish King to demand Øresundstolden, or Sound Dues. This was where all ships entering the Baltic had to pay a tax to the Danish king. If they refused, the cannons on either side of the sound would open fire on the ship and sink it. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1585 the castle was rebuilt under Frederick II of Denmark. This is when the castle became the large Rennaisance castle which it is now. In 1639 the castle was rebuilt by King Christian IV, after a fire ten years earlier. Less than 20 years later the castle was conquered by a Swedish army under Carl Gustaf Wrangel. Following this, the castle was heavily fortified moreso than before.</Text>

It was constructed under the orders of Mehmed II "The Conqueror", under whom the city was captured from the Byzantines and renamed Istanbul, as part of a scheme to re-build the city following the sucessful Ottoman siege. The palace served as the official residence of the Ottoman sultans for nearly four centuries of their rule, lasting until Sultan Abdul Mecid I moved the court to a newly-built palace further up the Bosphorous in 1856. Topkapi Palace is in fact more of a walled village than a palace, with several small buildings and many courtyards as opposed to one central structure. The site is home to many relics and artefacts collected both by the Sultans and following the end of the Ottoman empire when the palace was turned into a Museum. Among these are relics sacred to the Islamic world, including a door to the Great Mosque of Mecca, as well as what is said to be the cloak and sword of the prophet Muhammed. Other items include many collected from Silk Road trade, such as various pieces of Chinese porcelain from across four different dynasties of rule, and a collection of Islamic weaponry spanning approximately 13 centuries.

One of the most famous ships to go down a history, the Santa Maria, was a carrack that carried Columbus and his crew to discover the new world. Another famous ship of this design belongs to Vasco Da Gama, the Portuguese explorer who circumnavigated Africa, discovering a new route to spices of India.

			<Text>The word cruiser was applied originally to frigates of the sailing era, which, being smaller and faster than ships of the line, cruised the seas scouting for enemy fleets and hunting enemy convoys. As the designation for a specific type of warship, cruiser did not become current until about 1880, when navies had settled on iron-hulled ships powered either by a combination of sail and steam or solely by steam. Cruiser, then, became the standard designation for a large surface warship built for high speed and great cruising radius, capable of not only defending its own fleet and coastlines but also threatening those of the enemy. By about 1900, cruisers were of two principal kinds: protected cruisers had steel armour plating only on their decks, while armoured cruisers also had armour extending down the sides of the hull. Though smaller than battleships, cruisers were powerful warships because of their great speed and relatively big guns.</Text>

These expeditions, and the maps they helped create, became blueprints for the conquest and domestication of the once uncharted regions of the world.</Text>

			<Text>A field gun is a piece of light artillery that can be easily moved around the battlefield. During his wars in Europe, Napoleon used field guns to great effect. His employment of very large wheels allowed his guns to be quickly moved in the midst of battle, meaning enemy formations could be easily broken up. This strategy gradually became obsolete, however, as the development of road and rail, and the changing nature of the battlefield, allowed for most kinds of artillery to be moved at respectable speed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]By the beginning of the Second World War, the term 'field gun' had come to mean any long-range artillery piece that fired at a low angle. However, because of the demand for artillery which could fire at both long-range and a high angle during the later stages of World War II, field guns became largely supplanted by howitzers, and today the term sees no widespread application.</Text>

			<Text>“First-rate” is the classification used for the largest ships of the line maintained by the British Royal Navy.  Throughout the existence of the rating system, the threshold armament and crew for a ship to be considered first-rate changed.  However, it was established in the early 1700s that a first-rate ship loaded for wartime carried at least 100 guns.  First-rates were very expensive, heavy and slow in exchange for their massive firepower.  As a result, few were maintained at any given time, and they often served as flagships.  HMS Victory, Admrial Nelson’s famous flagship from the Battle of Trafalgar, is the only surviving first-rate.</Text>

			<Text>A galleon is the design of a multi-story sailing vessel attributed to the Venetians. Employed extensively in the fleets of Spain and other European states to further their naval militaristic interests, the galleon were formidable warships that weighed up to 2000 metric tonnes. The galleon was powered entirely by wind, using sails carried on three or four masts, with a lateen sail continuing to be used on the last (usually third and fourth) masts. They were used in both military and trade applications, most famously in the Spanish treasure fleet, and the Manila Galleons. Demoting the carrack to be used just for cargo, these vessels became the forefront of European armadas and went on to colonize the world.</Text>

			<Text>With the massive proliferation of guns from the middle of the 17th century, the battlefield became dominated by linear tactics, according to which infantry were arranged into long thin lines and fired volleys. A line consisted of 2, 3, or 4 ranks of soldiers. The relatively short range at which smooth bore muskets could accurately hit a target, added to the slow reload, meant that massed formation firing was essential for maximizing enemy casualties. The line was considered the fundamental battle formation as it allowed for the largest deployment of firepower. In the years following the Napoleonic Wars, line infantry continued to be deployed as the main battle force, while light infantry provided fire support and covered the movement of units. With the invention of new weaponry, the concept of line infantry began to wane; men walking in formation line-abreast became far too easy a target. The growing accuracy and rate of fire of rifles, together with the invention of the gatling gun and machine gun, meant that close order line infantry would suffer huge losses before being able to close with their foe. With the turn of the 20th Century, this slowly led to infantry increasingly adopting skirmisher style light infantry tactics in battle, while retaining line infantry drills for training.</Text>

			<Text>Skirmishers are light infantry or cavalry soldiers stationed ahead or alongside a larger body of friendly troops to harass the enemy. In ancient and medieval warfare, skirmishers typically carried bows, javelins, or slings. Acting as light infantry with minimal armor, they could run ahead of the main battle line, release a volley, and retreat before the clash of the opposing main forces. During the Napoleonic Wars the role of the skirmisher took on new notability, attempting to disrupt enemy forces by firing into their close-packed ranks and potentially causing early casualties and breaking enemy formation. A skirmish force screening the main body of infantry became so important that eventually all the major European powers developed specialized skirmishing infantry, e.g. the German Jäger and the French Voltigeurs. While muskets were the predominant weapon at the time, the British Army experimented with rifles, which soon became the predominant firearm. A consequence of these wars was a trend to train line troops to adopt skirmisher tactics. By the late 19th century, the concept of fighting in formation was on the wane, and the distinctions between skirmisher and heavy infantry have largely disappeared.</Text>
