			<Text>[COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]Workforces[ENDCOLOR] is a new gameplay mechanic. Your Workers now expend Build Charges in order to build Improvements. Instead of taking a number of turns to complete an Improvement, Improvements are now built instantly, consuming 'Charges' in the process. Each Worker may use these Charges until they have none left, at which point they are expended.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Roads, Railroads, Repairs, and Clearing Features still require a set number of turns to be completed, however, but they do not consume Charges.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Workboats are also subject to this new mechanic, but they start with only one Charge. This can be increased by researching certain Techs.</Text>

			<Text>The workforce is the labour pool in employment. It is generally used to describe those working for a single company or industry, but can also apply to a geographic region like a city, state, or country. Within a company, its value can be labelled as its "Workforce in Place". The workforce of a country includes both the employed and the unemployed. The labour force participation rate, LFPR (or economic activity rate, EAR), is the ratio between the labour force and the overall size of their cohort (national population of the same age range). The term generally excludes the employers or management, and can imply those involved in manual labour. It may also mean all those who are available for work.</Text>
