		'The Mandan arrived in the Missouri River region from the southeast (Ohio Valley) between about 1000 and the thirteenth century, perhaps as early as the seventh century. They gradually moved upriver and away from other Siouan-speaking people.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The first smallpox epidemics arrived in the early sixteenth century. The acquisition of horses in the early to mid-eighteenth century allowed the Mandan to expand their buffalo hunting, but they did not give up their sedentary lifestyle. During the mid-eighteenth century, the Mandan became intermediaries between French and Indian traders, dealing in furs, horses, guns, crops, and buffalo products.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Mandan suffered a gradual decline beginning in the late eighteenth century, owing primarily to smallpox and warfare with the Dakota and other tribes. In the early nineteenth century, Mandans were friendly to non-Indians, even allowing visitors to study their religious ceremonies. In 1837, a major smallpox epidemic dropped the Mandan population by over 90 percent, to just about 125 people. In 1845. surviving Mandans joined the Hidatsa people to establish Like-a-Fishhook village on the Missouri.'

		'The Hidatsas, an Indian people of the Northern Plains, have lived in what is now west-central North Dakota for nearlya millennium. The name Hidatsa, which refers to the willows growing on Missouri River sandbars, was once applied to a single band but later encompassed the entire people. Along with the Mandans and the Arikaras, the Hidatsas were the northernmost Plains people to construct large, permanent earth lodge villages and to practice agriculture intensively. Composed in the early historic era of three closely related bands-the Hidatsa-proper, Awatixa, and Awaxawi-each spoke a distinct dialect of Siouan language and maintained unique identities and traditions of separate origin. Awaxawi and Hidatsa-proper traditions describe the people emerging from an underground world near a large body of water, often identified with Devils Lake in eastern North Dakota, and a migration and later meeting with the Mandans, a people with whom the Hidatsas have been intimately associated to the present day. The Awatixas, in contrast, maintain they have always resided on the Missouri River.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The encounter with European and, later, European American newcomers placed unprecedented challenges before the Hidatsas. Some aspects of change were welcome, including the adoption of horses and the expansion of the long-established Aboriginal trade network to incorporate newcomers. But disease, decline in population, and the necessity of defense from the more numerous Sioux (Lakotas) proved especially daunting. Before the cycle of epidemics, the Hidatsas may have numbered 5,000 to 6,000 people, but at least as early as the 178os their population began to decline. In 1837 a smallpox epidemic killed half of the Hidatsa people in a matter of months, leaving only 1,200 to 1,400 survivors. These losses, combined with even more devastating losses suffered by the Mandans, led to the establishment of a single, shared village, Like-a-Fishhook, in 1845. There the Mandans and Hidatsas were joined by the Arikaras in 1862. In 1870 the three peoples were placed on the eight million-acre Fort Berthold Reservation in present-day central North Dakota. By the end of the nineteenth century, the Hidatsa population had declined to some 400 people.'

		'Long before European Americans entered the Great Plains, the Arikaras, who called themselves Sahnish, meaning “People,” separated from the Skiri Pawnees and moved northward to the Missouri River valley in present-day South Dakota. From that time on, they were associated more with the nearby Siouan-speaking Mandans and Hidatsas than with their fellow Caddoan-speaking Pawnees to the south.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Arikara culture changed dramatically in the eighteenth century, as the Lakotas challenged them for bison-hunting territory and smallpox epidemics decimated the tribe. By 1804, when Tabeau lived with the Arikaras, their eighteen villages had been reduced to three fortified settlements. That same year, Lewis and Clark described the Arikaras as “tenants at will” to the Lakotas. The Arikaras occupied these villages off and on until 1823, when they were attacked by Col. Henry Leavenworth as punishment for Arikara attacks on traders. In 1837, reeling from the effects of another devastating smallpox epidemic, most of the tribe moved north to join the Mandans and Hidatsas at Fort Clark. Ever since, Arikara history has been bound with that of the Mandans and Hidatsas, and in 1862 they settled with them at Like-a-Fishhook Village.'

		'Mato-tope was the second chief of the Mandan tribe to be known to whites as "Four Bears", a name he earned after charging the Assiniboine tribe during battle with the strength of four bears. Four Bears lived in the first half of the 19th century on the upper Missouri River in what is now North Dakota. Four Bears was a favorite subject of artists, painted by George Catlin and Karl Bodmer. Among his people he was a brave warrior, famous for killing a Cheyenne chief in hand-to-hand combat. He became friends with artist Karl Bodmer in 1833, and became chief in the year 1836. The 1837 Great Plains smallpox epidemic wiped out most of his tribe, leaving 27 (or by some accounts 100 to 150) survivors out of a former population of around 2,000. He died on July 30, 1837 after suffering from smallpox, brought to his tribe by whites. Before his own death, he lost his wife and children to the disease, and as recorded in his last speech to the Arikara and Mandan he denounced the white man, whom he had previously treated as a brother, for deliberately bringing the disease to his people. Four Bears lamented that in death his scarred face would be so ugly even the wolves would turn away from him. Smallpox wiped out more than 80 percent of the Mandan population in only a few months, and they were not the only tribe to suffer from the disease.'
