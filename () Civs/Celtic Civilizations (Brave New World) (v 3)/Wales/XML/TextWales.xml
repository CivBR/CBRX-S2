			<Text>A Caer is a royal residence in Wales during the first millennium AD or earlier. Caer can be loosely translated into castle, palace, or fort, but no English word captures the same characteristics as a Caer. A Caer was the home to both the king, his royal family, and entourage who consisted of loyal retainers, monks, scholars, chief advisors, and bards who provided entertainment. Caers were renowned for their great feasts that lasted as long as a year. In these feasts, kings and upper classes of multiple kingdoms would meet to show wealth and status in society. Caers weren't only palaces, they were defensive fortresses. They were usually hill forts, like the Camelot hill fort at South Cadbury in Somerset, or the coastal forts like Tintagel in Cornwall and Aberdyfi in Ceredigion. Small kingdoms only contained one Caer, but larger ones contained many.</Text>

			<Text>During the Anglo-Norman invasion of Wales, the Welsh Longbow was put into use. The English soon learned how powerful this weapon could be, and began to recruit Welsh Longbowmen into their own army. The Welsh Longbow is most famous for its role in the Battle of Agincourt, and the Hundred Years' War. The Longbowmen, using the Welsh Longbow, would fire a rain of arrows and the enemy. The Welsh Longbow was used until the development of gunpowder. Overall, the weapon was a powerful type of medieval longbow. The Welsh Longbow was difficult to master because of its draw weight. Because of the difficulty, many users of the Welsh Longbow were eventually deformed in their arms and wrists.</Text>
